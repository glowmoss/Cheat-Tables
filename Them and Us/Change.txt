 Changes:
- Added a few more scripts for god mode, inf ammo, etc
- Fixed the pointer to fearpoints
- Added a currently equipped weapon Pointer Section I forgot to add from the main table where I have shit everywhere.
- Got the inventory editor fully functional
I Explained it on the table but you can only edit weapons to other weapons and items to other items. 
If you want more options edit the item box or the dropped items as it doesn't matter if its an item or a weapon you can change whatever to whatever
